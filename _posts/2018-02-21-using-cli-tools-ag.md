At work, I am always using the default "find in location" feature of the text
editor. This is very helpful if you are searching for a specific string in the
whole codebase. The task, however, becomes tedious when you are trying to find
a list of strings individually in several codebases.

That's when I started to search for ways to automate it or at least ease my
problem and that's when I stumbled upon [The Silver Searcher][ag-searcher].

I really didn't know how to use command-line tools for searching through files 
didn't have what completely understood how to use the pipe `|` operator in the 
linux terminal. Also, this was a chance to try out how xargs can be used in this
scenario.
