# Ending The Year with New Ideas

I currently have 3 things in mind for self improvement projects that I wish to start next year. 

## Project 1: Facebook Chat Bot

I like to finalize my schedule as early as I can to make sure that I can make time for all the things that I need/want to do. One of the events that I need to squeeze in to my schedule is my dragonboat training. The schedule is constant but it depends on how many participants can come to the training day making it a bit unpredictable. To avoid this, I would like to automate the training announcements not only to know early on how many can come but also help the training organizer to decide earlier (and hopefully offload the actual task of sending announcements) if we will push through for the day.

The solution I thought of is to try and make a Facebook chat bot that automatically sends training schedule announcements every morning. The task is simple: *to make regular announcements automatically*. Although I am also thinking if it is possible to extend the functionality to actually accept responses and add or remove members to the atendee list. 

Let's see how it goes.

## Project 2: Learn A New (Programming) Language Deeply

I feel I am confident with the current scripting language that I use regularly. As a developer, it is my responsibility to myself to always keep updated with the trends in Web Development. One of the languages that I was able to use but not fully dive into is Javascript. It's currently widely used and it will enable me to extend my skills specifically in front-end web scripting. I am currently looking at two Javascript technologies right now: Vue.js and Node.js.

Aside from Javascript, I also find Ruby to be interesting so I might also find time to check it out and compare it with Javascript to see which one of those is worth investing my time in. I believe that both are good but I don't have enough knowledge yet to decide the proper use for each and decide which will be more useful for me.

## Project 3: Computer Science Mentorship

To keep my edge and help others grow as well, I'd like to conduct some knowledge sharing about some fundamental computer science (and mathematics) concepts. One of my takeaways from the University is that aside from knowing the concepts, one of the goals of studying is to improve critical thinking. If my team and I will do the same thing everytime, it might not be good for us in the long run. So I'd like to always challenge them to push and practice their critical thinking through these activities. 

This one is already started and I already created a github repository to collate all the code challenges that I plan to use.

I've already set minimum goals for the next year. Some more might be added, but these will definitely be the minimum requirement that I set for myself.
