Previously, I created my blog in a [Digital Ocean droplet][digital-ocean-home]
where I setup everything from scratch and set it up to host other static
websites for different purposes but finally I gave up.

I had difficulty with this setup, mainly because of two things: static IP
address and impracticality.

Since I decided not to buy a domain name, I don't have anything to attach to
the droplet I created so I had to access it using a static IP which is very
hard to remember. I also think that it is hard to recall for those who are
reading my posts (assuming there are).

Aside from having static IP address, paying $5.00 every month for a server that
has low traffic and no monetary return is a bit impractical. It is not
regularly updated so there is no point in spending monthly for an inactive
website.

I love Digital Ocean and the possibilities you can do with it. But for blogging
or static site hosting, consider other free ones first. Thankfully, [Github
Pages][github-pages-home] does that. It also supports [Jekyll][jekyllrb-home]
so I didn't have to setup much.

Expect more posts to come here.
