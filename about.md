I am Jerome. I work and mostly stay in Metro Manila, PH. I graduated from the University of the Philippines in Diliman with a degree in Computer Science (which I think I am not yet maximizing).

I do Web Development mainly on PHP but am always on the lookout to find the next language to dive into. I currently work with a group of people to maintain websites in the company for. I aim to be a mentor to this group and to do that, I am also learning about team dynamics and management stuff in the hopes of imparting what I learned.

While doing all that I mentioned above, I also try to maintain a balanced life by reading books and doing physical activities whenever I can.
